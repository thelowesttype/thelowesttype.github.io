Not trying to scare poeple with the thought of us seeing robots taking over ~~cause they already have~~. If you ask me robots are nothing but an evolved homosapien. That being said now that this website is ready *phew*.
<br> Let the fun beg.in. My plan is to use this to write documentation and if time permits a step-by-step guide. I want to write around 2 articles + projects doc every month. Will use blog area to talk about things which aren't technical or I just want to talk about some random thing.
<br><br>
To just show off the ability of site let's try few things shall we?<br>
1. This is how code will render as
    ```python
    # This is a comment, and is ignored by the compiler
    class moveRobo:
        def __init__(self):
            moveit_commander.roscpp_initialize(sys.argv)
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        rospy.init_node("move_robo", anonymous=True)
    ```
    Looking good! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1520808873/3643/cool-doge.gif?1520808873" width="30" style="padding-bottom: 20px;"/>
    Let's try inline code `cout << "Stop doing fucking Hello, World!";`. ~~Oops~~ I got carried away

    How does bash look like you might ask?
    ```bash
    $ sudo rm /*
    ```
2. What about headings? <br>
    - # H1
    - ## H2
    - ### H3
    - #### H4
    - ##### H5
    - ###### H6
3. Let's see some Katex while we are at it
    $$
    \varphi = 1+\frac{1} {1+\frac{1} {1+\frac{1} {1+\cdots} } }
    $$
4. Images?<br>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="/blog/hello/me2.png" style="width: 75%"></img>
    </div>

Oh don't forget to press the terminal button on the top for some **nice** suprise. <br> <br>
<span style="color:green">$</span> press <kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>F4</kbd> to end the session.
