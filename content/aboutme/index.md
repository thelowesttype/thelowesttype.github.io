My academic interests are in **Robotics, Controls, Computer Vision and Machine Learning.**

*My story you ask?*
<br>
Since early days of my schooling I have been ~~breaking~~ making things.<br>
Creating water level indicator back in 6<sup>th</sup> grade started my roller coaster journey in field of electronics by introducing me to a transistor and by and large to this beatiful domain where ~~mostly~~ everyting is possible. And then I quickly realized, this is what I want to keep on doing in my life.
<br> <br> In my free time, I also dabble with swimming, long cycling journeys, little bit of design, animation and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7BLVR5OvHzaD7utOEuk94g" target="_blank">SFX projects</a>. I also love percussion instruments like tabla, drums.
