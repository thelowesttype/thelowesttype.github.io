## Quick Start

It provides tools to grab images from a google search by extracting the
links of the images and downloading original images.

This module is written for windows 10 or Ubuntu 16.0 and above on 64-bit processor. It uses
Selenium to open browser so as to scroll down to get more images than
possible otherwise. Thus it **needs a browser** to work correctly. This
is on *default* set to use *chrome browser* in case of inability to open
it Firefox will be used. The package comes with chromedriver and
geckodriver with it.
