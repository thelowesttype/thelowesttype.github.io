But before we dive into how I achieved that let's get a few basics right.\n\nFew ideas work on the first try. Iteration is key to innovation.\n\n- Sebastian Thrun\nWhat is motion planning?\nMotion planning is a term used in robotics for the process of breaking down the desired movement task into discrete motions that satisfy movement constraints and possibly optimize some aspect of the movement.\n\n\n    \n        \n        Trajectory of robot moving through obstacles\n    \n\nWhat are the usual approaches for it?\nCollision avoidance algorithm is mainly of 2 types: global and local. Some of the global techniques are graph-based, potential field methods and cell decomposition. You can check out the article I wrote about a graph-based approach for a multirobot system here. Global approaches require a complete model of the robot and environment to plan the path. This makes them a bit slow to avoid fast moving obstacles and also if the environment model is not completely accurate.\n\nWhereas local planner considers only a small part of the entire model to make the decisions. But they usually provide a solution that is less optimal and it is more prone to being stuck in local-minima. But they can make a decision at a faster pace and are able to make decisions in a partially available world model. Vector field histogram is a type of local planner approach which uses an occupancy grid to form a model of the nearby environment using sensors. Utilizing the occupancy grid and Artificial Potential Field (APF) it plans the path for the robot.\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        Occupancy Grid for given map\n    \n\nShortcomings of previous approaches and Dynamic Window Approach (DWA)?\nAll the approaches discussed above don't really take the limitations of the robot into consideration (like max acceleration). To deal with this DWA was proposed.\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        Trajectory planned by DWA\n    \n\n\nWith the introduction out the way let's get to how DWA works!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scope of the article will mainly deal with the algorithm proposed in the original paper[1].\n\n\nEquations defining robot drive\nTo be able to provide with motion plan within the limitation of the robot we need to model the robot's drive (How does the robot move). To simplify things we'll consider it to be a mobile robot with a differential drive\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        Kinematics of differential drive\n    \n\n\nGeneral motion equations can be written as:\n$$\nx(t_{n}) = x(t_{0}) + \\int_{t_{0}}^{t_{n}}v(t) \\cdot \\cos(\\theta(t)) dt\n\\\\[2em]\ny(t_{n}) = y(t_{0}) + \\int_{t_{0}}^{t_{n}}v(t) \\cdot \\sin(\\theta(t)) dt\n$$\nwhere,\n$$\nx(t_{n})\\space and\\space y(t_{n})\\space is\\space the\\space position\\space of\\space the\\space robot\\space at\\space time\\space t_{n}\\\\\nand\\space v(t) \\space  denotes \\space  velocity \\space  at \\space  time \\space  t\\\\\nand\\space \\theta(t) denotes \\space  orientation \\space  at \\space  time \\space  t\n$$\nRewriting v(t) and θ(t) in terms of initial configuration and acceleration as:\n$$\nx(t_{n}) = x(t_{0}) + \\int_{t_{0}}^{t_{n}} \\bigg( v(t_0) + \\int_{t_0}^t a(\\hat{t}) d\\hat{t}\\bigg) \\cdot \\cos\\bigg(\\theta(t_0) + \\int_{t_0}^t \\Big( \\omega(t_0) + \\int_{t_0}^t \\alpha(\\hat{t}) d\\hat{t} \\Big) dt\\bigg)\\\\[2em]\ny(t_{n}) = y(t_{0}) + \\int_{t_{0}}^{t_{n}} \\bigg( v(t_0) + \\int_{t_0}^t a(\\hat{t}) d\\hat{t}\\bigg) \\cdot \\sin\\bigg(\\theta(t_0) + \\int_{t_0}^t \\Big( \\omega(t_0) + \\int_{t_0}^t \\alpha(\\hat{t}) d\\hat{t} \\Big) dt\\bigg)\n$$\nwhere,\n$$\na(\\hat{t})\\space and\\space \\alpha(\\hat{t})\\space are\\space linear\\space acceleration\\\\\nand\\space angular\\space acceleration\\\\\nin\\space time\\space interval\\space \\hat{t}\\in[t_0,t]\n$$\nWith this, we have equations that are based on initial configuration and acceleration only!\n\nConsidering hardware restriction, all the variable values will be discrete in nature and hence the above equations need to be discretized. Further, we can simplify them by approximating constant robot velocity for a short interval of time [ti,ti+1]. Doing so introduces error in the trajectory but because the robot's position is measured periodically we can neglect it. The final motion equation can be written as,\n$$\nx(t_{n}) = x(t_{0}) + \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\\int_{t_{i}}^{t_{i+1}}v_i \\cdot \\cos\\bigg(\\theta(t_i) + \\omega_i \\cdot (\\hat{t}-t_i)\\bigg)d\\hat{t}\\\\[2em]\ny(t_{n}) = y(t_{0}) + \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\\int_{t_{i}}^{t_{i+1}}v_i \\cdot \\sin\\bigg(\\theta(t_i) + \\omega_i \\cdot (\\hat{t}-t_i)\\bigg)d\\hat{t}\n$$\nwhere,\n$$\nn\\space denotes \\space number \\space of \\space time \\space intervals\n$$\nAfter further simplification of the integral one can transform the above equations into a circular trajectory equation. Something like this,\n$$\n(F^i_x - M^i_x)^2 + (F^i_y - M^i_y)^2 = (\\frac{v_i}{\\omega_i})^2\n$$\nwhere,\n$$\n(M^i_x,M^i_y) \\space represents \\space center \\space of \\space i^{th} \\space circle\n$$\nDWA Approach\nIn this approach, the search for the best trajectory is done in the velocity space. The trajectory of the robot is a sequence of circular arcs. Each arc/curvature is defined by (vi,ωi). Hence from the above equations, we can say that to reach the goal point for the next n interval we need to determine (vi,ωi) for each of those n intervals.\nWindowing\nThe way we introduce the dynamics of the robot is by limiting the velocity space being used to find the best trajectory. This operation is called windowing and it restricts the velocities to only the velocities which can be reached within a short interval of time given the max acceleration of the robot.\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        Possible Trajectories\n    \n\n\n$$\nV_d = \\bigg\\lbrace(v,\\omega) | v\\in[v_a - a\\cdot t,v_a+a\\cdot t] \\land \\omega \\in [\\omega_a - \\alpha \\cdot t, \\omega_a + \\alpha \\cdot t]\\bigg\\rbrace\n$$\nwhere,\n$$\na \\space and \\space \\alpha \\space are \\space acceleration\n$$\nAvoiding Obstacles\nThe above space is then again pruned by considering the only safe trajectories. A trajectory is considered safe only when the pair (v,ω) can stop before it reaches the nearest obstacle.\n$$\nV_a = \\bigg\\lbrace(v,\\omega) | v\\le\\sqrt{2\\cdot dist(v,\\omega)\\cdot\\dot{v_b}} \\land \\omega\\le\\sqrt{2\\cdot dist(v,\\omega)\\cdot\\dot{\\omega_b}}\\bigg\\rbrace\n$$\n\n    \n        \n        Admissible Trajectories (Note: The obstacle was in the middle)\n    \n\n\nFinally we can write the resulting search space as\n$$\nV_r = V_s \\cap V_a \\cap V_d\n$$\nOptimization of the trajectory\nNext, we need to select the best trajectory amongst the admissible ones. To do this we use the following optimization function in the Vr space.\n$$\nG(v,\\omega) = \\sigma(\\alpha\\cdot heading(v,\\omega) + \\beta \\cdot dist(v,\\omega) + \\gamma \\cdot velocity(v,\\omega))\n$$\nwhere,\n$$\n\\sigma \\space is \\space for \\space smoothing\n$$\n\nAmongst a set of given trajectory the one with highest G(v,ω) is selected.\n\n\n    \n        \n        Robot's trajectory (green - admissible traj, red - selected traj)\n    \n\n\nTarget Heading\nheading(x,ω) function evaluates the alignment of the robot to the target heading. It is given by 180-θ, where θ is the delta between the heading of the robot after it undertakes a given trajectory and the angle goal point makes from the current position of the robot.\n\n\n    \n        \n        Kinematics of differential drive\n    \n\nClearance\ndist(x,ω) function evaluates the minimum distance to the nearest obstacle when a given trajectory is followed. This helps to select the trajectory having the highest clearance from the obstacles.\nVelocity\nvelocity(x,ω) function just returns the translation velocity robot will have at the end of the trajectory. This helps to select the trajectory which goes the fastest.\nDistance to Goal\ngoalDistance(x,ω) function returns the distance between the robot and the goal after it undertakes the given trajectory. This is an addition to the parameters given in the paper. This helps to undertake a trajectory that brings the robot closest to the goal. This is extremely helpful when one allows negative velocities in the window.\nResults\nThe algorithm was implemented in C++ and ROS was used as middleware between the program and the robot. The following were the weights and parameters of the robot.\n\nImplementation Result\nVideo of simulation and implementation on a real robot can be seen here:\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\nObservations\nAs we discussed in the usual approaches local planning gets stuck in local minima and hence needs some additional force (recovery behavior)to get out of it. In the given implementation this part was lacking and hence to mimick recovery behavior the robot was rotated by hand so that it could come out of the given minima. Another realization that happened while making the program was that DWA requires a fast loop time and hence algorithms implemented on python aren't best suited for this purpose.\nUp-Next\nThe code base is available here.

And why and what I am trying to achieve here.\nLet's start with why the hell I need to do all this?\n\nAny sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\n\n- Arthur C. Clarke\nWhy?\nSo this was a brainchild of the trying to replicate delivery of packages to multiple places using any number of robots. Hence this raised the need to be able to plan in multiagent fashion.\n\nWhat was I trying to achieve?\nSo my aim in the team was to come up with a planning method which will be able to coordinate between all the different robots such that they don't collide. Now this needs to happen keeping in mind that overall performance of the robot should be maximized.\n\n\n\n\n Multiple Mobile Robots, Path Planning and Motion Coordination \n\n\n\nSolving this problem can be divided into 2 broad categories: coupled approach and decoupled approach. This division is broadly based on the computational requirement and optimality of the solution generated by the method. In multi-agent problems one needs to achieve optimal balance between achieving computational complexity and optimality of the solution.\n\nFor this reason I wished to go with the decoupled approach. It’s way less taxing on the computation side and should give an optimized path.\n\nDefining the Problem Statement\nThe following was how the arena on which testing was done looked like. The black regions are obstacles and the small notches made at (1,5) and (1,10) are the starting positions. The white area is where the robots can move around. The goals (9 in total) are given in the middle of map as a group of 4 black boxes.\n\n\n    \n        \n        Arena for testing\n    \n\n\nFor this problem statment, I had to make the following assumptions:\n\n- Related to Agent\n    - Start and goal configuration for each agent is clearly defined.\n    - They move at constant speeds.\n    - Their trajectory is followed closely with small error.\n- Related to Environment\n    - Environment (or the workspace) is fully observable.\n    - Environment is a discrete space, which the agent can move only at fixed units of distance.\n- Related to Execution\n    - It’s a centralized execution system\n    - Execution is done using a frame based system.\nPrevious Work\nAmong the highly cited papers I found was one stuck out for the simplicity and the beauty, “A Distributed and Optimal Motion Planning Approach for Multiple Mobile Robots” written by Guo and Parke, 2002 [1]. They talk about an approach of using coordination diagrams to do collision checks and then maximize the performance attribute of all the robots by varying the velocity profile of the robots. This approach is quite straightforward but in the scenario I tried it in there were quite a lot of times the robots ended up in deadlock as it was not changing the path of the robots.\n\n    \n        \n            \n            Coordination diagram for three robots. \n        \n    \n\nGoing into more detail we can define the solution, where each agent Ri\ncharts a path\n$$\\tau:[0,1] \\xrightarrow{} R_{s,free}^i $$\nCoordination diagram is used to optimize the velocity of each agent,\n$$ X = [0,1]^m $$\ncoordination diagram for m robots. When agent is at 0 its considered to be at its starting position and when it reaches 1, it has reached the goal. The objective can be then defined to reach to\n$$ h(0,1) \\xrightarrow{} X_{free} $$\nwhere $$ X_{free}= X - X_{obs} $$\nBased on the above explanation we can define global performance index to be:\n$$\n\\tau = \\beta_1\\times max(T_1,T_2,...Tm) + \\beta_2\\times \\sum_{i=1}^m T_{idleTime,i} $$\nwhere, Ti denotes time spent by each of the m agents to reach the goal, IidleTime,i denotes idle time for the robots and \tβ1, β2 are the weights.\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n            Simulation Results of Nomad 200 Robot\n        \n    \n\n\nTo solve this problem one use D* velocity planning, where the cost function would something like:\n$$\nf_v = \\eta + \\alpha_1d+\\alpha_2t_{idleTime} + \\alpha_3p\n$$\nwhere η is some large value tending to ∞, tidleTime is the total idle time for all the m agents, d is euclidean distance from current position to the goal point, p is the penalty incurred when the agent has to stop and let other agent pass.\n\nPrivate Obsctacle Planning\nIn this method instead of trying to manipulate the velocity of the agents such that they don't collide, we try to change their paths. First each agent plans its path towards their goal locations independent of other robots. Then collision detection and interchange detection is done for each pair of robots. Collision detection can be defined as when R1 is moving from (x1,y1) to a common location (xc,yc) while R2 is also moving from (x2,y2) to the common location then its defined as collision. Interchange detection is the case when R1 is going (x1,y1) → (x2,y2), but R2\nis also going (x2,y2) → (x1,y1) even though they aren't at the same position at a singular point but this will also lead to a collision. This can also be thought of as a subset of the Collision detection where they collide at (x1.5,y1.5) considering R1 R2 are moving at constant speed. But as our assumption was that we have a discrete space we cant define x1.5 hence the need to define Interchange detection.\n\n\n\n\nBefore and After Collision Avoider\n\n\n\n\nOnce collisions are detected in accordance to priority order between different agents R1,...,Rm we need to define private obstacles ωi which is are obstacles, local and private to Ri agent. ωi depends on the priority order and collisions taking place between each agent Ri.\n\n    \n        \n            \n            Time Taken for Planning\n        \n    \n\n\nThe time complexity of this problem is O(rn3), r is number of time slices, $n$ is number of edges in the system. From this we can observe it is faster method than Coupled Path Planing as it's reducing a high dimensional problem into one with much lower dimensional space. The only disadvantage with this method is that it doesn't consider the possibility of reducing speed or stopping agents at various time instants, hence the solution found might not be the most optimum one.\nFuture Work\nTo further optimize the algorithm one can use randomize search technique (hill climbing) to evaluate the best possible priority order for a set of agents. Going into detail how one can do this is by first starting off with initial priority order scheme selected in such a way that the agent with the longest path is given higher priority, one with the shortest path is given the least priority. Then priority order is exchanged between two agents in the scheme. If the new scheme results in a solution with shorter overall path of the agents than the best one found so far, it continues with this new order.\nSince hill-climbing has local min-mima problem, algorithm performs random restarts with different initial\norders of the agents to minimize this issue to the least this thus defines, another cycle of trial. Like this we will have maxCycles denoting how many of these cycles it need to perform before selecting the best solution between them. We also define maxJumps to limit the max time spent on each cycle.\nUp Next\nIn future I want to talk about how the algorithum is exactly working and try to quantize the results with different style and sized arena. Once the project is done will put all the documentation in the project section of the website.\n\n\n\n\nTeaser Image\n\n\n\n\nAlso fun-fact you can subscribe to the blog using RSS!

You plug it in, power it up… and the happiness evaporates instantly.\nThere are fifty users, all blessed with root access, and the hard drive is so full that the desktop won't even load. That's when it hits you — the reality of what you've just inherited.\nYou're not just getting a server; you're inheriting years of chaos. You'll need new hard drives, a proper user management system, and—let's face it—you'll probably end up writing half the management software yourself. Because who else will?\nAfter fixing the same problems approximately 472 times, I decided it was time to automate the pain. Hence, this lovingly chaotic survival manual for Server Maintenance — a place where Docker reigns supreme and /scratch is your only true home.\n\nIn theory, automation saves time. In practice, it just breaks faster while you're asleep.\n- 2AM me\n\nThe Server in Its Current Form\nLet's start with what the server actually is today. It's a GPU-powered workspace for robotics, vision, and AI research. Everyone gets their own sandbox, isolation via Docker, and shared resources when needed.\nThe key services running include:\n\nDocker – The heart of everything. All user workloads run here.\nNVIDIA Container Toolkit – GPU passthrough support so your PyTorch models don't cry.\nTelert – Powers discord alert and notification system.\nPrometheus + Grafana (planned) – For proper monitoring, once I stop duct-taping scripts together.\nCustom maintenance scripts – Bash automation for user creation, cleanup, and resource tracking.\nCronitor - To keep track of the maintenance scripts\n\nStorage lives under /scratch/, managed via LVM, so we can expand capacity when someone inevitably drops a 500GB dataset in the wrong place.\nEach user has:\n\nA personal /scratch/&lt;username&gt; directory\nAccess to GPUs via Docker\nA shared /scratch/common space for collaborative data\nAnd, ideally, no root access (anymore)\n\nThe Usage SOP (Standard Operating Procedure)\nEvery user runs their workloads only through Docker containers. That's non-negotiable — partly for security, partly because that's the only way the server stays sane.\nThe basic workflow is:\n\nLog in via SSH: ssh username@10.40.29.169\nNavigate to your personal directory: cd /scratch/&lt;username&gt;\nLaunch your environment using Docker (custom image or base image). Sample Dockerfile\nSave all outputs back into your scratch space\nClean up after yourself\n\nCommon Docker Commands You'll Actually Use\n\nThere's also a shared etiquette:\n\n/scratch/common is not your personal archive. Use it for temporary sharing.\nGPU usage is monitored — so don't hog them. Ideally would have loved the server to be running SLURM but for a 1 GPU system felt like overkill at that time.\nOld containers and images are purged automatically. Don't panic when they disappear.\n\nIn short: use the server like a polite houseguest. Leave it cleaner than you found it (Sadly not everyone will do that. And hence you need enforcers too!)\nThe Initial Setup: From Chaos to Functionality\nWhen I first got the server, the plan was simple — wipe as little as possible and make it functional again. Of course, nothing is ever simple.\nPhase 1: Storage Salvation with LVM\nThe existing drives were a mess, and we needed expandability. LVM (Logical Volume Management) was the answer.\n\nTo make it permanent, I added this to /etc/fstab:\n\nThe beauty of LVM? When someone inevitably fills the disk again, I just add another drive, extend the volume, and resize the filesystem. No downtime, no data migration.\nPhase 2: User Management Overhaul\nEveryone's root access was revoked. Users were re-created with isolated directories and proper permissions. I wrote two scripts that became my best friends — and eventually, the backbone of the entire user management system.\nThe create_user.sh script handles everything from account creation to sending welcome emails. The delete_user.sh script ensures safe removal with optional workspace backup. These aren't just convenience tools — they enforce consistency and security that manual management could never guarantee.\n(See The Maintainer Toolkit section below for detailed breakdown of how these scripts work.)\nPhase 3: Docker and GPU Setup\n\nI also moved Docker's root directory to avoid filling up the system partition:\n\nThe Maintainer Toolkit: Teaching the Server to Look After Itself\nOnce the server reached a somewhat stable state, I realized there was no going back — maintenance wasn't a one-time thing. I needed to build tools that could manage users, track usage, and keep resources under control without my constant intervention.\ncreate_user.sh — The Onboarding Wizard\nThis script is my answer to \"can you give me access to the server?\" Instead of manually creating users, setting up directories, configuring permissions, and sending welcome emails, I now just run one command.\nBasic usage:\n\nWhat happens under the hood:\n\n\nValidation first — Checks if the script is run as root, validates username format (lowercase, starts with letter/underscore), and verifies email format. Because the last thing you want is a user named \"admin@123\" breaking your system.\n\n\nUser creation with security baked in:\n\nThe temporary password airl was chosen because it's memorable but meaningless. Users can't avoid changing it — the system forces them to on first SSH login.\n\n\nWorkspace setup with proper isolation:\n\nThe 700 permissions are critical. Nobody else can peek into your directory, not even other users. Privacy by default.\n\n\nAutomated email notification — The script sends a complete onboarding email with:\n\nSSH connection details\nTemporary password (with explicit instructions to change it)\nWorkspace location\nUsage guidelines (Docker-only policy)\nDiscord channel link for support\n\nThe email template is built right into the script, so you can customize it for your lab's specific needs. Mine includes a \"GPU goes burrr\" signature because why not.\n\n\nWhy this matters: Before this script, user onboarding took 15-20 minutes of manual work. Now it's a single command and 30 seconds. More importantly, it's consistent — every user gets the same secure setup, no exceptions, no forgotten steps.\ndelete_user.sh — The Responsible Bouncer\nRemoving users is trickier than creating them. You can't just run userdel and call it a day — what about their data? Their running processes? Their Docker containers?\nUsage patterns:\n\nThe deletion workflow:\n\n\nValidation and confirmation — Checks if user exists, verifies root access, and asks for explicit \"yes\" confirmation. No accidental deletions allowed.\n\n\nProcess termination:\n\nKills all running processes owned by the user. The sleep is important — some processes are stubborn and need a moment to realize they're dead.\n\n\nDocker group cleanup:\n\nRemoves Docker access before deletion. Otherwise, the user's containers might become orphaned.\n\n\nWorkspace handling — The critical decision:\nOption A: Save the workspace (default and recommended)\n\nThe script copies the entire workspace to /scratch/user_backups/username_timestamp/, changes ownership to the maintainer account (iris), and locks down permissions. It also creates a metadata file with:\n\nOriginal username and path\nBackup timestamp\nServer hostname\nReason for backup\n\nThis is the safe option. Maybe the user left important results behind. Maybe they're coming back. Maybe you just don't want to be responsible for deleting someone's PhD thesis.\nOption B: Delete the workspace (use with caution)\n\nPermanent deletion. The script asks for confirmation twice — once at the start, once before actually nuking the directory. I've seen too many \"wait, I needed that\" moments to skip the double-check.\n\n\nUser account removal:\n\nIf this fails (sometimes it does), the script falls back to userdel username followed by manual home directory cleanup. Always have a Plan B.\n\n\nReal-world usage patterns:\n\n\nTemporary collaborator leaving: --save (default). Their data might be useful later, and storage is cheaper than regret.\n\n\nUser explicitly requested deletion: --delete after confirming they've backed up everything they need.\n\n\nCleaning up after a workshop: --delete for temporary accounts that were only used for demos.\n\n\nThe backup structure looks like this:\n\nEvery backup is timestamped, documented, and owned by the maintainer. If someone comes back six months later asking \"where's my data?\", you can actually find it.\nusage_monitor.sh — The Enforcer\nThis script runs every 15 minutes via cron and is responsible for keeping the server sane. It monitors everything, throttles misbehaving processes, and cleans up Docker waste.\n\nWhat it monitors:\n\nCPU usage (threshold: 80%)\nMemory usage (threshold: 80%)\nDisk usage (threshold: 80%)\nGPU usage\n\nWhat it does when thresholds are breached:\n\nSends notifications via Telert\nThrottles CPU-hogging processes\nStarts cleanup procedures if disk is full\nDeletes oldest and largest files from /scratch (after warnings on Discord)\n\nDocker cleanup priorities:\n\nBuild cache\nStopped/exited containers\nUnused images (except whitelisted ones)\nDangling volumes\n\nThe whitelist protects critical images from auto-deletion. You can customize it in the script.\nScheduled Automation with Cron\n\nMy current setup:\n\nNotification System with Telert\nSetting up Telert was surprisingly painless:\n\nNow, every script can send notifications:\n\nIt's integrated into all monitoring scripts. When something breaks at 3 AM, I get a message. When cleanup finishes, I get a message. It's like having a server that actually talks back.\nEmergency Commands You'll Need\nWhen things go sideways (and they will), here's your survival kit:\n\nThe Pain Points and the Lessons\nEvery setup has scars. Here are a few from mine:\nStorage growth is relentless. No matter how much space you add, someone will fill it with raw data dumps. LVM was a lifesaver, but automation to delete old files became mandatory.\nMonitoring is a full-time job. Without automation, you'll never catch overuse in time. The moment you stop watching, someone will spawn 50 containers and consume all the RAM.\nAutomation saves your sanity. Anything you can script, you must. Otherwise, you'll repeat the same fix every week. My monitoring scripts have saved me more weekend debugging sessions than I can count.\nRoot access ruins everything. It took one afternoon to revoke and three days to recover from what others had done. Never again.\nDocumentation is for future you. I wrote everything down, not for others, but because 2 AM me forgets what 2 PM me configured. This blog is partly that documentation.\nThe Workflow in Practice\nHere's what a typical day looks like now:\nMorning: Check Discord notifications. See that usage_monitor flagged high disk usage last night and cleaned 50GB automatically. No intervention needed.\nMidday: New lab member joins. Run create_user.sh, they get an email with credentials and instructions. They're up and running in 5 minutes.\nEvening: Someone accidentally fills their directory with dataset copies. Monitoring script catches it, sends a warning, and if they don't clean up, automatically removes the oldest files after 24 hours.\nNight: Weekly cleanup runs automatically. Docker cache cleared, old containers removed, logs rotated. I wake up to a notification that everything completed successfully.\nThe server mostly runs itself now. I finally have time to get back to robotics — though part of me secretly enjoys watching the maintenance logs scroll by at 2 AM, knowing it's all working by itself.\nWhere to Find Everything\nAll the scripts mentioned here are available:\n\ncreate_user.sh — User creation automation with email notifications\ndelete_user.sh — Safe user removal with workspace backup options\nusage_monitor.sh — The main enforcer for resource monitoring and cleanup\nSample Dockerfile — Template for users\n\nThe full technical documentation with every command, configuration file, and troubleshooting step lives in the maintainer guide. This blog is just the highlights and the philosophy behind it all.\n\nI never planned to become a sysadmin. I just wanted a stable compute setup for robotics work. But when you inherit a half-broken machine full of mystery users and full disks, you learn fast. Now, with automation in place, the server mostly runs itself (even after I left the lab).\n\n$ press CTRL+W to end the session.\n","id":"https://thelowesttype.github.io/blog/server-setup/","title":"Server-Shenanigans"},"https://thelowesttype.github.io/blog/template-matcher/":{"body":"The goal was to create a template matching algorithm that can run in sub-200ms and is position, scale, and rotation invariant. The built-in template matching function of OpenCV is robust but only if you have positional invariance requirement. It fails if the object in the live footage rotates with respect to the master image.\nAnother algorithm explored was feature-matching. This ticked all the boxes. It is positional, rotational, and scale-invariant. But the challenge here was that it depends heavily on the individual blobs of the master image.\nAs you can see in the following image:\n\n\n\nFeature Matching\n\n\n\nIt picks up the features on the object which are too reliant on having that exact object shown to the system again. This is certainly improbable, and just having an extra scratch on the object will make the system reject it. Hence this may work in simulations but for real-life dataset, this can't be used.\nHence, I end up with FFT based template matching technique. For this, I used these papers as my basis [1], [2].\nThe architecture discussed in the papers had a higher runtime so it had to be optimized. I took only the bare bones of the architecture explained in the paper and applying filters and calculations which were less intensive. Allowing the algorithm to reach the set parameter.\n\n\n\nLet's look at the technique:\nThe main tool leveraged in this method is FFT's time shift property -\n$$\nf_2 \\lparen t \\rparen = f_1 \\lparen t-t_0 \\rparen\nF_2 \\lparen t \\rparen = e^{-j\\omega t_0}F_1 \\lparen t \\rparen\n$$\nBut instead of time shift we will use it to calculate shift in x and y axis. \n$$\nf_2 \\lparen x,y \\rparen = f_1(x-x_0,y-y_0) \\newline\nF_2(\\xi,\\eta) = e^{-j2\\pi(\\xi x_0+\\eta y_0)}F_1(\\xi,\\eta)\n$$\nNow imagine consider F1 and F2 to be two images. So now when we take cross-power spectrum of the two images we get,\n$$\n\\frac{F_1(\\xi,\\eta)F_2^*(\\xi,\\eta)}{|F_1(\\xi,\\eta)F_2(\\xi,\\eta)|} = e^{j2\\pi(\\xi x_0+\\eta y_0)}\n$$\n\nHence we can get the change in location as a power of e. But considering our target is to first find the angle, we need to convert the image from Cartesian plane to Polar plane. But even that won't be enough as the change in angle will be coming as a power of e. Thus, we need to take log-polar transform of the image. One more point to note is that even though we want just the rotation to be detected. But as we are going to apply this algorithm in real life it is possibile that the scale of the image also changes. This is due to distortion of lens and a number of other factors. Hence, we technically need to see the scale and rotation of the image.\n\nConsidering just rotation and translation for now,\n$$\nf_2 \\lparen x,y \\rparen = f_1\\lparen x \\cos{\\theta_0} + y \\sin{\\theta_0} -x_0, -x \\sin{\\theta_0} + y \\cos{\\theta_0} -y_0 \\rparen \\newline\nF_2\\lparen x,y \\rparen = e^{-j2\\pi(\\xi x_0+\\eta y_0)}F_1 \\lparen \\xi \\cos{\\theta_0} + \\eta \\sin{\\theta_0},  -\\xi\\sin{\\theta_0} + \\eta \\cos{\\theta_0}\\rparen\n$$\nTaking Magnitude both sides,\n$$\nM_2(x\\xi,\\eta) = M_1(\\xi \\cos{\\theta_0} + \\eta \\sin{\\theta_0}, -\\xi\\sin{\\theta_0} + \\eta \\cos{\\theta_0})\n$$\nHence we can write it as,\n$$\nM_1(\\rho,\\theta) = M_2(\\rho,\\theta - \\theta_0)\n$$\nHence the angle can we found. Taking into account the scaling property of Fourier Transform,\n$$\nf_2 = f_1(ax,by)\\newline\nF_2(\\xi,\\eta) = \\frac{1}{|ab|}F_1(\\xi/a,\\eta/b)\n$$\nSo, for a rotated and scaled image we can write,\n$$\nM_1(\\rho,\\theta) = M_2(\\rho/a,\\theta-\\theta_0)\n$$\nTaking log both sides\n$$\nM_1(\\log \\rho,\\theta) = M_2(\\log \\rho - \\log a,\\theta-\\theta_0)\n$$\nUsing,\n$$\n\\xi = \\log \\rho \\enspace \\text{and} \\enspace d = \\log a\n$$\n$$\nM_1(\\xi,\\theta) = M_2(\\xi - d,\\theta-\\theta_0)\n$$\nNow, we can get both angle and scale by which the live image correlates to the master image. Now working off the angle value we rotate our template image and then use the OpenCV built-in template matching function working off coefficient score. This will provide us with the location of the object and then the data is sent to the Camera Setup.\n\n\n    \n        \n        Template rotated to match the angle of an object in the live feed\n    \n\n\nAlgorithm\nHere, I am just giving you a brief of the whole algorithm and major steps involved in it. Readers are encouraged to read more about it by themselves through research papers.\n\n    \n        \n        Algorithm Flow\n    \n\nFilter\nDue to changes in lighting for our setup, we had to add a filter to keep the exposure almost similar throughout the day.\n\n    \n        \n        Filter Application\n    \n\nApodization\nThe algorithm is basically to smooth out the border of the image to get rid of the tail noise in an image signal. Something like this,\n\n    \n        \n        Apodization Process - Live Image\n    \n\nDFT of the Image\n\n    \n        \n        DFT\n    \n\nApplying High Pass filter in Polar Coordinates\nThe yellow region means 1.0 and the purple region means 0.0\n\n    \n        \n        Filter Function\n    \n\n\nAfter applying it to the image this is what you get,\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        Result\n    \n\nLog-Polar Conversion\nAs mentioned in the Algorithm section instead of just Polar-Transformation we actually need log-polar transform.\n\n    \n        \n        Log-Polar Transform of DFT\n    \n\nCross-Power Spectrum of the Images\nYou can notice a small dot almost in the centre of the image. That dot is a unit function denoting the angle and scale with which the live image has changed as compared to the template.\n\n    \n        \n        Cross Power Spectrum\n    \n\n\n\nConclusion\nThis is part of a bigger project I worked on. After I talk about other parts of this project, I will post the codes and explain you how to test it on your system. So stay tuned over the blog section. Once everything is explained here I will post the guide on the projects section of the website. Also fun-fact you can subscribe to the blog using RSS!
